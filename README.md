#MedEx

MedEx is an Android-based platform which provides a solution to a problem 
which the healthcare industry has been facing since the beginning of medicines: 
The problem of wastage of medicines which occurs due to expiration.
We collect soon-to-expire medicines from consumers and transfer them to subscribed hospitals
which sell medicines off the counter for short term use.
The users get points which they can later redeem for discount coupons and the medicines also get used.
